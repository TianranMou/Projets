"# Projets" 


Before u use, u have to install the database correctly,

Just run the init_dp.php, u can change the name of the database in this file but dont forget
to change in the pdo.php where create the connection to the database

and if u want to test something or get into the develop environment, add "   include 'devEnv.php'     " at the beginning in the php file
